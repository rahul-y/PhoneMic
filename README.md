# PhoneMic

This app is an attempt to make phone act as a Mic.
As soon as you connect your phone to speaker, it can act as a Mic.

ToDo:

1. Record and Play Simultaneously
2. Add Server Client Relationship in case one phone is kept with speaker and acting as receiver and another with you acting as a transmitter.
